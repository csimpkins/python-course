# Structured Programming

Any algorithm can be expressed by:

- Sequence - one statement after another
- Selection - conditional execution (not conditional jumping)
- Repetition - loops

We’ve already seen sequences of statements. Today we’ll learn
selection (conditional execution), and repetition.

# Binary Values

There are 10 kinds of people:

- those who know binary, and
- those who don't.

# Python Booleans

In Python, boolean values have the `bool` type. Four kinds of boolean
expressions:

- `bool` literals: True and False
- `bool` variables
- expressions formed by combining non-`bool` expressions with comparison operators
- expressions formed by combining `bool` expressions with logical operators

# Comparison Expressions

Simple boolean expressions formed with comparison operators:

- Equal to:` ==`, like $=$ in math

    - Remember, `=` is assignment operator, `==` is comparison operator!

- Not equal to: `!=`, like $\ne$ in math
- Greater than: `>`, like $>$ in math
- Greater than or equal to: `>=`, like $\ge$ in math
...

Examples:

```Python
1 == 1 # True
1 != 1 # False
1 >= 1 # True
1 > 1  # False
```

# Logical Expressions
