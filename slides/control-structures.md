% Control Structures

# Structured Programming

Any algorithm can be expressed by:

- Sequence - one statement after another
- Selection - conditional execution (not conditional jumping)
- Repetition - loops

We’ve already seen sequences of statements. Today we’ll learn
selection (conditional execution), and repetition.

# Binary Values

There are 10 kinds of people:

- those who know binary, and
- those who don't.

# Python Booleans

In Python, boolean values have the `bool` type. Four kinds of boolean
expressions:

- `bool` literals: True and False
- `bool` variables
- expressions formed by combining non-`bool` expressions with comparison operators
- expressions formed by combining `bool` expressions with logical operators

# Comparison Expressions

Simple boolean expressions formed with comparison operators:

- Equal to:` ==`, like $=$ in math

    - Remember, `=` is assignment operator, `==` is comparison operator!

- Not equal to: `!=`, like $\ne$ in math
- Greater than: `>`, like $>$ in math
- Greater than or equal to: `>=`, like $\ge$ in math
...

Examples:

```Python
1 == 1 # True
1 != 1 # False
1 >= 1 # True
1 > 1  # False
```

# Logical Expressions

Simple boolean expressions can be combined to form larger expressions using logical operators and, or, and not.

```Python
(1 == 1) and (1 != 1) // False
(1 == 1) or (1 != 1) // True
```

# Truth in Python

These values are equivalent to `False`:

- boolean `False`
- `None`
- integer `0`
- float `0.0`
- empty string `""`
- empty list `[]`
- empty tuple `()`
- empty dict `{}`
- empty set `set()`

All other values are equivalent to True.

# The `if-else` Statement

Conditional execution:

```Python
if boolean_expression:
    # a single statement executed when boolean_expression is true
else:
    # a single statement executed when boolean_expression is false
```

- *boolean_expression* is not enclosed in parentheses
- `else:` not required

Example:

```Python
if (num % 2) == 0:
print("I like " + str(num))
else:
print("I’m ambivalent about " + str(num))
```

# Blocks

Python is block-structured. Contiguous sequences of statements at the
same indentation level form a block. Blocks are like single statements
(not expressions - they don’t have values).

```
if (num % 2) == 0:
   print(str(num) + " is even.")
   print("I like even numbers.")
else:
    print(str(num) + " is odd.");
    print("I’m ambivalent about odd numbers.")
```

# Multi-way `if-else` Statements

This is hard to follow:

```Python
if color == "red":
    print("Redrum!")
else:
    if color == "yellow":
        print("Submarine")
    else:
        print("A Lack of Color")
```

This multi-way if-else is equivalent, and clearer:


```Python
if color == "red":
    print("Redrum!")
elif color == "yellow":
    print("Submarine")
else:
    print("A Lack of Color")
```

# Short-Circuit Evaluation

Here’s a common idiom for testing an operand before using it:

```Python
if (kids != 0) and ((pieces / kids) >= 2):
    print("Each kid may have two pieces.")
```

In this example Python uses short-circuit evaluation. If

`kids != 0`

evaluates to `False`, then the second sub-expression is not evaluated, thus avoiding a divide-by-zero error.

# Loops

Algorithms often call for repeated action, e.g. :

- “repeat ... while (or until) some condition is true” (looping) or
- “for each element of this array/list/etc. ...” (iteration)

Python provides two control structures for repeated actions:

- `while` loop
- `for` iteration statement

# `while` Loops

`while` loops are pre-test loops: the loop condition is tested before the
loop body is executed

```Python
while condition: # condition is any boolean expression
    # loop body executes as long as condition is true
```

Example

```Python
>>> def countdown(n):
...     while n > 0:
...         print(n)
...         n -= 1
...
print(’Blast off!’)
...
>>> countdown(5)
5
4
3
2
1
Blast off!
```

# `for` Statements

`for` is an *iteration* statement

- iteration means visiting the elements of an iterable data structure

In the for loop:

```Python
>>> animal = ’Peacock’
>>> for animal in [’Giraffe’, ’Alligator’, ’Liger’]:
...     print(animal)
...
Giraffe
Alligator
Liger
>>> animal
’Liger’
```

- `animal` is assigned to each element of the iterable list of animals in successive executions of the `for` loop’s body
- notice that the loop variable re-assigned an existing variable

# `break` and `else`

- `break` terminates execution of a loop
- optional `else` clause executes only of loop completes without
executing a `break` (weird - don't ever write code with `for`-`else`)

```Python
>>> def sweet_animals(animals):
...     for animal in animals:
...         print(animal)
...         if animal == ’Liger’:
...             print(’Mad drawing skillz!’)
...             break
...     else:
...         print(’No animals of note.’)
...
>>> sweet_animals([’Peacock’, ’Liger’, ’Alligator’])
Peacock
Liger
Mad drawing skillz!
>>> sweet_animals([’Peacock’, ’Tiger’, ’Alligator’])
Peacock
Tiger
Alligator
No animals of note.
```

# List Comprehensions

A list comprehension iterates over a (optionally filtered) sequence,
applies an operation to each element, and collects the results of these
operations in a new list.

```Python
>>> grades = [100, 90, 0, 80]
>>> [x for x in grades]
[100, 90, 0, 80]
>>> [x + 10 for x in grades]
[110, 100, 10, 90]
>>> [x + 50 for x in grades if x < 50]
[50]
```

List comprehensions are a concise way to accomplish transformations
which could otherwise be done with loops.

# Run-time Errors

An error detected during execution is called an exception and is represented at runtime by an exception object. The Python interpreter raises an exception at the point an error occurs. The exception is handled by some exception-handling code. Here we don’t handle the ValueError ourselves, so it’s handled by the Python shell:

```Python
>>> int(’e’)
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ’e’
```

We can handle an exception by enclosing potentially error-raising code
in a try block and handling errors in an except clause.

```Python
try:
    code_that_may_raise_error()
except ExceptionType:
     code_that_handles_exception()
```

`ExceptionType` is optional. If left off, except clause will catch any
exception.

# Exception Hnadling Example

```Python
>>> def get_number_from_user():
...     input_is_invalid = True
...     while input_is_invalid:
...         num = input(’Please enter a whole number: ’)
...         try:
...             num = int(num)
...             # Won’t get here if exception is raised. ’
...             input_is_invalid = False
...         except ValueError:
...             print(num + ’ is not a whole number. Try again.’)
...    return num
...
>>> get_number_from_user()
Please enter a whole number: e
e is not a whole number. Try again.
Please enter a whole number: 3
3
```
