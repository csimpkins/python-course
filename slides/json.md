# Representing Data in Text Formats

We've seen two ways of representing data in text formats so far:

- CSV files, and

    - Simple one record per row format
    - Can't represent nested structure

- XML

    - Elements represented by tags
    - Tree structure models nested data
    - Verbose

Today we'll see a third way, JSON, which has much of the expressive power of XML with much less verbosity.

# JSON

- Stands for JavaScript Object Notation
- Valid JavaScript code
- Often valid Python code

# CSV Redux
