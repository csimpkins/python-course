**IMPORTANT**: Include [PyBootcamp Student] in the subject of course-related email, e.g., "Subject: [PyBootcamp Student] functools Question." Professors are deluged with email. If we don't respond, don't take it personally. Just resend your email with a friendly reminder.

## Course Description

This course will provide you with the Python programming competency necessary to begin using Python as a fundamental tool in computing activities such as data analytics.

## Learning Outcomes

Student in the class will achieve the following learning objectives:

(Competency) Students will be able to:

1. Write programs using various data types, and using basic techniques such as assignment, function calls, while loops, for loops, and conditionals.
2. Use and manipulate several language provided data structures such as: Lists, Dictionaries, and Strings.
3. Read and write data to and from text files, both as plain text and in structured formats (such as CSV).
4. Read a textual representation of numerical data and convert it to the appropriate (integer/floating point) data type.
5. Implement simple business or mathematical algorithms (calculating interest payments, averaging a row of data, calculating standard deviation) into a program.
6. Use compound data structures provided by the programming language such as lists, arrays, and dictionaries to hold sequences or sets of data, including two-dimensional (tabular) data.
7. Use objects and associated methods provided by the programming language.
8. Write programs that are easy to understand so that others may modify and improve them.

(Movement) Students will increase their:

1. Familiarity with compound data structures (lists, arrays, dictionaries), including nested data structures (multi-dimensional arrays, etc...) and indexing into multi-dimensional data structures.
2. Speed and accuracy in converting problem statements into programs.
3. Understanding of and ability to quickly use basic program structures such as iteration, conditionals, and function calls due to repeated practice of these concepts.
4. Ability to break a medium sized problem down into smaller parts and solve each sub-problem individually.
5. Ability to test and debug programs.

(Experience) Students will:

1. Practice the process of constructing moderately sized (100-300 line) programs from written requirements.
2. Deal with data that may include missing elements or malformed representations.
3. Work in pairs to solve programming problems.

## Prerequisites

Programming ability in a general purpose programming language, not necessarily Python, such as would be acquired in a rigorous university introductory programming course such as Georgia Tech's CS 1301, CS 1315, or CS 1371.
