# Resources



## Get Started

Try to do the following before the first day of class.

### 1. Install Python

- **Recommended**: [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html). Be sure to get the Python 3 version! Once you have Miniconda, open your terminal application (or `cmd` on Windows), and enter the following commands (`$` is the command prompt on most Unix shells. It would be something like `C:\>` in Windows's terminal, cmd. You don't type/copy the prompt from shell examples like this.):

```sh
$ conda update conda
$ conda install numpy pandas scipy matplotlib scikit-learn ipython-notebook
```

For the Python bootcamp you don't technically need the second line above, but these are common packages used in data analytics.

- Alternate methods: [Installing Python](installing-python.html) (But, seriously, just use  [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html). It's the best thing to happen to Python package management, well, ever.)

### 2. Choose, install and configure a text editor using our [text editors guide](text-editors.html).


### 3. Check Your Python Installation


1. Open a terminal, i.e., operating system (OS) command shell.

    -  The Mac OS X terminal is `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app` in the Finder.  You should drag Terminal to your dock -- you'll use it often.

    - On Windows search for and run `cmd.exe`, for example by simply typing `cmd` in the start search box.

2. At the command prompt type `python3 --version`.  You should get a response like `Python 3.5.2 :: Continuum Analytics, Inc.`.

    - Note: on Windows the Python 3 command is just <code>python</code> (without the 3). Anaconda/Miniconda also aliases `python` to `python3`.


## Learn About Programming and Computing

- [Basic Unix](http://matt.might.net/articles/basic-unix/) - a tutorial introduction to the Unix command line
that will give you the basic skills you need for this class should you choose to use a unix-like operating system like Ubuntu Linux or Mac OS X
- [Text Editors](text-editors.html) - an intro to text editors for beginning programmers
