# Getting Started

It would be best to do the following before the first day of class, but you must have these steps done by the end of the first day.

- Install Python:

    - **Recommended**: [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html). Be sure to get the Python 3 version! Once you have Miniconda, open your terminal application (or `cmd` on Windows), and enter the following commands:

    ```sh
    $ conda update conda
    $ conda install numpy pandas scipy matplotlib scikit-learn ipython-notebook
    ```

    `$` is the command prompt on most Unix shells. It would be something like `C:\>` in Windows's terminal, cmd.
